# 30 Days of LeetCode JavaScript Challenge
Every day starting **May 5**, LeetCode will pick one JavaScript problem to solve. Solve the daily problem to win rewards and master basic JavaScript skills. JavaScript beginners are welcome to join the event, which makes the event even more attractive.
For those moments when it is not possible to leave the place there is the "Editorial" section, where it is possible to read an article with topics related to the problem in question. As well as discussing possible solutions in the official community of LeetCode dedicated exclusively to this challenge.
Below is the table with the days and the challenges:

Day       | Problem   | My solution
